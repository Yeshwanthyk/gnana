* Can't mix various types in lists
* An **If** function should always have an else block
* List can be joined together using ***++***; but have to noted that when we do
  that haskell has to traverse the whole list on the left hand side.
* we can use ***:*** which is the **cons** operator:

        5:[1,2,3] => [5,1,2,3]
* We can use ***!!*** to get the index of a list. (Strings are basically lists!!)
