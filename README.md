Gnana
=====

jñāna : Knowledge (Sanskrit)

While I start working through different books and projects I just want a single place where I can keep track of my progress


Most of the notes I have taken while working through the books are at [notebook](http://notebook.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

Working through some of the following:
* [Learn You A Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)
* [Discover Meteor](http://www.discovermeteor.com)
