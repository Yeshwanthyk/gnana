Gnana
=====

jñāna : Knowledge (Sanskrit)

While I start working through different books and projects I just want a single spot to keep track of my progress

Also, why create a million repos for each new topic I want to explore.

I am trying to put in README's explaining new things learnt for now. The goal is to move them on to my [notebook](http://notebook.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)

Working through some of the following:
* [Learn You A Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)
* [Discover Meteor](http://www.discovermeteor.com)
